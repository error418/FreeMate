### BUILDING
- SuperStrong Mate Tea (1 liter):
  - Boil 1 liter water.
  - Add 5 tablespoons of Yerba Mate Tea.
  - Let it sit for at least 7 minutes.
  - Filter it through a coffee filter. This makes it less cloudy.
  - Let it cool down and finally put it in the fridge.

If you want no additional sugar in your installation skip the following steps
  
- Dissolved sugar in water:
  - Pour 2dl water in a small pot and boil.
  - Add sugar and stir until the solution becomes a little bit thicker than water.
  - Don't add too much sugar, then it will not be easy to use later.

### INSTALLING
- For each serving of FreeMate:
  - 20% SuperStrong Mate Tea
  - Add one of the following
    - Add as much sugar as required by your system, but don't take too much
    - Add apple juice until the sweetness of the instance has reached adequate levels
  - Add a few dashes of Lemon Juice
  - Mix it well
  - Add Carbonated Water
  - Mix carefully
  - Ready for consumption

### TESTING
- Every now and then, compare your FreeMate installation with a Club Mate. This will let you realize what a fantastic beverage you have created.
